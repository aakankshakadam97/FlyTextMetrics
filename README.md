# FlyTextMetrics
## üöÄ Project Overview

- Extracted customer reviews of British Airways flights from a travel review website using web scraping.
- Classified reviews into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** categories using NLP.
- Visualized sentiment trends using charts and word clouds.
- Analyzed flight booking data to discover **customer ticket buying behavior**.
- Applied machine learning to predict which **days of the week** typically have the most flight bookings.
